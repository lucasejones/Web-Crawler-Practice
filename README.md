# Web-Crawler-Practice

This is a sort of companion repo to the Django-Site repo I'm also working on. Both repos ultimately seek to create a centralized location where civil engineers can easily determine the certification status of various manufacturers' products. 

While the other repo is focused on creating the site the engineer will ultimately interact with, this repo focuses on building the web scraping tool that will supply the data to that site.

As it currently stands, the files in here are not specific to these certification sites, but I will update this readme as I progress towards my goal.
